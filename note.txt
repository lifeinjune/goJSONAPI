note for the project that things that i found along with project
1. build an Endpoint
    * API endpoint is one end of the communication channle to another system.
    * For API, endpoint can include URL of server or service
2. Downlaod dependencies
    * dep ensure command used to add dependecies on Gopkg.lock file
    and download source code for thos dependencies to vendor/github.com/gorilla
    directory
    * So when build the project these dependencies will be compile
    into binary no external requirement need to run the compiled code
3. run the code~!
    basic request /healthcheck matched with healthCheck Handler
    and returns json format data back to client
