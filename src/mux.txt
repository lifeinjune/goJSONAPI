understanding mux

-mux stand for HTTP request multiplexer
-http.serveMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests against
a list of registered routes and calls a handler for the route that 
matches the URL or other conditions

-main features of mux:
    * Request can be matched with URL host, path, path prefix, schemes
    header and query values, HTTP methods or using custom matchers.
    * URL hosts, paths and query values can have variables with 
    optional regular expression
    * Registered URLs can be built or "reversed", which helps
    maintaining references to resources
    * Routes can be used as subrouters: nested routes and route inside
    parent route must matched first
    * mux implements the http.Handler interface so compatible with 
    standard http.ServeMux.
